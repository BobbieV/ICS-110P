# Test Yourself: Simon Says

# Simon Says is a memory game where "Simon" outputs a sequence of 10 characters
# (R, G, B, Y) and the user must repeat the sequence.

# Create a for loop that compares to two strings.
# For each match, add one point to user_score.
# Upon a mismatch, end the game.

user_score = 0
simon_pattern = 'RRGBRYYBGY'
user_pattern = 'RRGBBRYBGY'



print('User score: ', user_score)
